# Open Z80 Emulator (WIP)

Z80 is a CPU that is upwardly compatible with Intel 8080, announced by Zilog in 1976. Its advanced design, such as the ability to perform 16-bit operations with register pairs while using an 8-bit CPU, is worth using in the modern era, and it has been used in the modern era that has passed nearly half a century.

This repo. provides the emulator of Z80 for C++ by signle header.
